## Introduction

As one of the most commonly consumed products, soft drinks/water products have far-reaching effects beyond simple weight gain. In severe cases, consumption can lead to hospitalization, disability, or even life-threatening consequences. To better understand these risks, we leverage the openFDA Food, Dietary Supplements, and Cosmetic Adverse Event API, which provides data from the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS). This database contains information on adverse event and product complaint reports submitted to the FDA from 2004 to 2025-02-16.

Our goal is to explore various product types within the soft drink and water industry, identify vulnerable groups (such as age and gender), and analyze the reactions, severity of impact, and correlation of symptoms associated with these products.
